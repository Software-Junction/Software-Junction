            <p>
              Prescription Pad is a user-friendly medical software designed for
              doctors in India. Developed by Dr. Anil Vij, Chairman, and Medical
              Director, this software streamlines prescription writing with
              features such as offline prescription storage, duplicate medical
              certificates, readymade prescription templates, and day-to-day
