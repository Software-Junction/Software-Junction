            <p>
              FreshBooks is a small-business accounting software product that's
              well-suited for freelancers and independent contractors. It stands
              out with its solid phone support and customizable invoicing
              features. However, it's not ideal for fast-growing businesses
              because of user and client limits on some of its plans.
